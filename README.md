BlocklyProp Launcher
=======================

Introduction
-----------------

The BlocklyProp Launcher is an application built using web technologies that connectes Parallax Propeller-powered hardware to the BlocklyProp website.  Targeted for the Chromebook platform initially, this application may replace the Python-based BlocklyPropClient at a later time.

It serves as the local conduit through which the cloud-based BlocklyProp Editor can download applications to, and debug with, the Propeller microcontroller.

Running
-----------------

BlocklyPropClient_Web has been written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is packaged as a Chrome Application.  After installing the Chrome Application, simply click to run it on a Chromebook.

Building
-----------------

To date, this application has been built using the [Chrome Dev Editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-dev-editor/pnoffddplpippgcfjdhbmhkofpnaalpg)
