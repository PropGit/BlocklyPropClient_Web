    * generated packet contains the Propeller handshake, timing templates, and core code from the Micro Boot Loader (IP_Loader.spin),

        - Optimal encoding means, for every 5 contiguous bits in Propeller Application Image (LSB first) 3, 4, or 5 bits will be translated
          to a byte.  The process uses a translation array (for speed)- input up to 5 bits and the bit count (ie: indexed into the pDSTx array)
          and output a byte containing the first 3, 4, or 5 bits of the input encoded into the Propeller download stream format plus the number
          of bits actually encoded.  If less than 5 bits were translated, the remaining bits lead the next 5-bit translation unit input to the
          translation process.
    If loaderType is not ltCore...
    * packetIds should be less than 0 for this type of packet in order to work with the Micro Boot Loader core.
    * clockSpeed and clockMode are omitted.
    * generated packet is a snippet of loader code aligned to be executable from inside the Core's packet buffer.  This snippet is in raw
